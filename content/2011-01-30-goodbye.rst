The lyrics
**********

Verse
=====

.. line-block::

   [F#m]Like a lonesome voice, [A]in the crowd,
   [F#m]like a broken toy, [A]left on the ground,
   [Bm]I feel like I've been left behind, [D]been canceled out,
   [Bm]no one's right here by my side,
   [Esus4]no one is a[E]round.

   [F#m]I've been on this empty road, [A]for quite some time,
   [F#m]I've been searching out for love, [A]but never could find mine.
   [Bm]It always ran away from me, [D]I never was that fast,
   [Bm]I had just a simple dream, [D]but it couldn't l[Esus4]a---a[E]st ...


Chorus

.. line-block::

   [A]Good-[C#m7]bye, [D]my [E]everlasting dre[A]am,
   [A] [C#m7] [D] [E] [A]
   [A]Good-[C#m7]bye, [D]love is [E]never like it s[A]eems
   [A] [C#m7] [D] [E]
   Cause when there's [Dmaj7]love there's misery,
   which is a[Asus2/C#]lways finding me,
   love has a b[Bm]etter place to [Esus4]be,
   like [F#5]me.


Verse
=====

.. line-block::

   [F#m]If only I could understand, [A]why it is me,
   [F#m]is it just my bad luck or my [A]destiny?
   [Bm]what is it what the others do? what [D]is it? Please tell me.
   [Bm]I guess I will never know, so I say [D]goodbye to my [Esus4]drea--[E]m.

Chorus
======

.. line-block::

   [A]Good-[C#m7]bye, [D]my [E]everlasting dre[A]am,
   [A] [C#m7] [D] [E] [A]
   [A]Good-[C#m7]bye, [D]love is [E]never like it s[A]eems
   [A] [C#m7] [D] [E]
   The only [D]thing I [E]now do [F#m]fear,
   is [D]someone [E]getting [F#m]near,
   Who will [D]brake my [E]heart and [F#m]then,
   I have to [Esus4]say goodbye ag[E]ain.
