When working with Pro Tools you may find yourself in a position where you need to create a few takes of for example a chorus. Instead of creating a completely new track for every take you do, you can simply create what is called a playlist in Pro Tools.

Shortcut
********

You can create a playlist using the right control key and the backslash symbol like :code:`RCTRL - \ `.

There is also another shortcut assigned if you may not have remapped it in OS X or it may be mapped to something else by default. That shortcut would be :code:`LCMD - LALT - LSHIFT - \ ` where the letter :code:`L` denotes the keys on the left side of the keyboard are pressed.
