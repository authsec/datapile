:summary: How to create a USB stick with Linux.

Sometimes you quickly need to boot up a PC with Linux. DVD drives may still be available in some PCs, but there is computer hardware without a CD/DVD drive out there.

For this example we're using the KNOPPIX live Linux that you can download from one of the many `mirrors <http://knopper.net/knoppix-mirrors/>`_.

Once you've downloaded the ISO image you need to have a program available that allows you to flash the ISO to the USB stick. I recommend `balenaEtcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_ as it is easy to use and available for all the major platforms.

The only thing left to do after loading the ISO image and selecting your USB stick as a target is to hit the "Flash!" button and use your new Linux USB stick.
