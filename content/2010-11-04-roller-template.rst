:summary: Theme/Template for Apache Roller.

Since there has been some interest in the roller template that I have designed, I decided to upload it here, so you can freely use it. You probably want to exchange the pictures and if you do have to modify any of them template files, I suggest taking a deeper look into the `template guide <http://opensource.become.com/apache/roller/roller-4/v4.0.1/docs/roller-template-guide.pdf>`_.
